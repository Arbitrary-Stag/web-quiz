# web-quiz

## Description
This is the fourth challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to create from scratch an interactive multiple choice web quiz that is capable of locally storing high scores, and features a timer that is dynamically modified by a users correct and incorrect selections. 

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
Once the user has navigated to the webpage they will be greeted by an introduction screen in which they can click a start button to begin taking the quiz based on a popular anime/manga. The user will then be asked a series of multiple choice questions that will provide feedback based on their selection. A timer is also shown in the upper right corner and begins counting down from 45s. Each correct answer adds 5s to the timer and each incorrect answer causes 5s to be subtracted. If the user runs out of time or answers all 5 questions within the alloted time they are taken to a finished screen where they can elect to store their high score and username. Upon saving their score they are then shown the current top 5 high scores and given the option to either clear the high score table or to take the quiz again.

## Credits
